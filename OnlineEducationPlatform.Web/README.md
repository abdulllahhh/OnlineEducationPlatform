## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### ✅ 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OnlineEducationPlatform.git
cd OnlineEducationPlatform
```

### ✅ 2. Restore Packages

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### ✅ 3. Set Up Local Database

Ensure you have **SQL Server LocalDB** or equivalent running. Then:

- Update the connection string in `OnlineEducationPlatform.Web/appsettings.Development.json` (create this file if missing):

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=OnlineEducationDb_YourName;Trusted_Connection=True;"
  }
}
```

> 🛡️ Each developer should use a **unique local DB name** to avoid conflicts.

### ✅ 4. Apply Migrations & Initialize the DB

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project OnlineEducationPlatform.Infrastructure --startup-project OnlineEducationPlatform.Web
```

---

### ✅ 5. Run the App

```bash
dotnet run --project OnlineEducationPlatform.Web
```
